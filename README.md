# MAIAC_MODIS_data_handling_for_python
A demostration for working with the latest high resolution MODIS Aerosol product MCD19A2 created using MAIAC algorithm.

### This repository aims to get a basic understanding of the process by which we can handle raster datasets in python. This repository in no way is the absolute way of getting started but, it is my recommendation as it is probably the easiest way out of the many out there. I hope you all will like this easy-going code. To jump to jupyter notebook explaining code please click here()
